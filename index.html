              Welcome Friends! I’m so glad you’re here. You being here, puts a
              smile on my face, and in return I hope my photographs do the same
              for you! I see each day as a gift, so let’s live this gift to its
              fullest! Lets document those special times that we want to
              treasure forever. Catching that authentic laugh, that gentle
              embrace or that tear on your BIG day, theres so much to be
              grateful for! I have been capturing these special moments since
              2009 and love every minute of what I do. My heart overflows with
              joy knowing that most of my clients have become like family to me!
              Im honored to have followed some of my clients from their wedding
              day, to the birth of their first child, to graduation day. Seeing
              families grow through the years is the most rewarding part of what
              I do!

          “MARY HAS BEEN TAKING OUR FAMILY PHOTOS FOR OVER 10 YEARS! SHE IS
          CREATIVE AND CAPTURES THE BEST MOMENTS EVEN WHEN MY KIDS AREN’T
          COOPERATING. SHE ALWAYS CAN MAKE US LAUGH! WE WOULD RECOMMEND HER TO
          ANYONE WHO WANTS NOT ONLY POSED PHOTOS, BUT ALSO CANDID SHOOTS. SHE’S
          THE BEST!” – ERICA

          “WE HAVE WORKED WITH MARY FOR 12 YEARS NOW, FROM ENGAGEMENT PHOTOS,
          PHOTOGRAPHING OUR WEDDING, NEWBORN PICS FOR ALL 4 OF OUR CHILDREN AND
          ALL THE MILESTONES IN BETWEEN. MARY IS FUN, ENERGETIC, AND CREATIVE.
          EVEN WHEN I LEAVE A SESSION, THINKING MY KIDS WERE A HOT MESS, THE
          FINAL PHOTOS ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL EVERY SINGLE TIME. MARY IS
          WONDERFUL WITH OUR VERY BUSY KIDS AND TREATS US LIKE FAMILY. WE ARE SO
          THANKFUL FOR HER BEAUTIFUL WORK!”
